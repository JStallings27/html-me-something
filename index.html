      <h2 class="layout">Before My First Console</h2>

      <p class="font25 layout">Since the earlier years of my life, I've loved activities that challenged me. I used to love doing crossword and jigsaw puzzles
             and I was very competitive when it came to anything pitting me against another. My competitive side really became to shine
             whenever I was in an arcade. I liked a variety of the games available, but fighting games always caught my eye just a little bit 
             more than the others. I was pretty good at the videogames, but not nearly as well off as the kids who would spend most
             of their time there, as I only got to go every other month or so, but I enjoyed every second of it when I did. </p>

        <h2 class="layout">Getting My First Ever Home Console</h2>

         <p class="font25 layout">As I mentioned in the previous section, I was never as good as other gamers due to having less opportunities to play 
                those games. Well, one day my mom surprised my brother and I with a Nintendo Entertainment System which you may know
                as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">NES</a>.

                 <br>			
	
                I was so ecstatic! Sure, it may not have been as big and flashy, nor had the same quality of graphics as the game towers
                in the arcade, but game systems back then didn't really have the power to handle amazing graphics that you see with today's 
                consoles. Even so, none of that was needed for my brother and I to have a blast for hours playing this new game console. We had
                a variety of games, such as 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_City_Ransom" target="_blank">River City Ransom</a>,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt" target="_blank">Duck Hunt</a>, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(NES_video_game)" target="_blank">Ninja Gaiden</a>, and a few others.
                Of course, you can't have a Nintendo based discussion without mentioning the oh so famous, Mario. 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros." target="_blank">Super Mario Bros.</a>
                was <strong>EASILY</strong> the game we played the most.</p>

      <h2 class="layout">Birth of the Competitive Spirit!</h2>

        <p class="font25 layout">I loved our NES, but even though the difficulty of the games gave me some challenges I will never forget, they never really 
        did much for my competitive side. They were mostly games you would take turns playing after you lost a life. It wasn't until our second
        console that my actual competitive spirit would come out. I've always been a huge fan of action movies, more so, movies that involved
        tons of martial arts. So there's no surprise that my heart in terms of videogames would sway to the side of fighting games. I had wanted
        for so long to not just play, but learn the different fighting games that i would enjoy at the arcade. I was pretty good at the other arcade
        games, but I would always lose in the fighting games due to my lack of practice. That all changed when we got our second game console,
        the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" target="_blank">SNES</a>.

        <br>

         With this system came some of may favorite fighting games to date. We had 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Street_Fighter_II" target="_blank">Super Street Fighter II</a>, 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_3" target="_blank">Mortal Kombat III</a>, and 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(1994_video_game)" target="_blank">Killer Instinct</a>.
         <strong>FINALLY!</strong>. I had my own personal fighting games that I could play a practice to my heart's content. My brother
         wasn't as big on fighting games as I was, but luckily my cousin was. He and I would play each other in some of the best fights, at
         our skill level during that time of course, and it was awesome! Playing other players who were equally matched with or better than me
         gave me that drive to hone my own skills in those games and gaming in general. That drive is the reason I beat my first game ever
         which was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World" target="_blank">Super Mario World</a>.</p>

         <p class="font25 layout">Since those days, I've owned dozens of consoles from different platforms. I mostly play on Xbox One these days; though, I do
         play on every new gen console. I love to play many genres; including platforming, adventure, <br>
         co-op horror, shooting and more, but regardless of what system or genre I play, my heart will always be within the heat of battle.</p>
